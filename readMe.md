## Travel Website
The animated website I created uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive. It has a menu bar through which the users can go through the whole website. The home page consists of a carousel wherein the users can see various tourist places which can attract them. The website consists of an about us section describing the website and a service section that describes the tourist place along with several images, providing the booking price and the rating of that particular place. The unique thing about the website is that it is a perfect travel website as it allows the users to many photos and videos, which makes it a user-friendly and reliable website. Then it has a slider with arrows to slide back and forth through the images, providing a great overview of the places the travel website offers and better quality images through pagination. The website also contains a newsletter section, a contact us section, and a map section where the users can see the actual location of the places mentioned on the website, which makes the website a better fit for customer use.
